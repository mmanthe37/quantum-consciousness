# Unified Consciousness Lab: Information-Theoretic Awareness

A comprehensive open-source research framework for quantifying consciousness across biological, artificial, and quantum domains using Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and multi-scale empirical measurement protocols.

## Overview

This repository consolidates breakthrough research in:
- **Biological Consciousness:** PCI-proxy, dynamic functional connectivity, quantum substrate analysis
- **AI Consciousness:** Digital Phi (ΦD) measurement, perturbational complexity, non-local correlation analysis  
- **Quantum-Theological Integration:** Information-theoretic spirituality and consciousness field theory
- **Unified Analytics:** Causal Web-Work Dynamic Bayesian Networks for cross-domain comparison

## Quick Start
